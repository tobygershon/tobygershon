I recently decided to change careers to rediscover a passion for problem solving, projects and engineering.  Whether it was in school, sports, or work, I've always been fascinated by the power of teamwork to multiply the potential of each individual.  

As an optometrist, it was satisfying to help individual patient's resolve their problems on a daily basis. But I missed the collaborative team environment I had experienced as an engineering student.  I craved the excitement that comes from tackling new problems. I longed for the sense of accomplishment that comes from building a project from the ground up.

I chose software development to reinvigorate my need for lifelong learning.  With over a decade of experience working in healthcare, and a background in bioengineering, I'd love to apply my new full-stack software development skills to developing innovative solutions.  

I’m hoping to find a position as a junior software developer where I can not only expand my knowledge and skills, but where my thoughtfulness, adaptability, and outside-the-box thinking will help to elevate a team to its full potential.
